# Linux Installation & Configuration Notes

## Chapter 1

### Linux is a Kernel

- Linux means the *kernel* of the system, which is the general controller of everything that happens on the computer
- Linux is a combination of software called **GNU/Linux** which defines the *operating system*
  - **GNU** is the *free software* that provides open source equivalents of many common UNIX commands
  - the **Linux** part of this combination is the *Linux kernel*, which is the core of the operating system
- the story of Linux begins with UNIX, an OS developed by AT&T Bell Labs in the 1970s
- UNIX is written in the C language
- Linux started in 1991 as a hobby project of Linus Torvalds, a Finnish born computer scientist studying at the University of Helsinki
- the **GNU Project** was developed by Richard Stallman in 1983
- Linux programmers were able to incorporate the GNU tools to provide a complete OS

### Linux is Open Source

- Historically, most software has been issued under a closed-source license
- you get the right to use the executable program or machine code, but cannot see the source code
- the development of Linux closely parallels the rise of *open source software*
- the open source philosophy is that you have a right to obtain the software source code and to modify it for your own use

### Linux has Distributions

- a *distribution* refers to the Linux kernel, tools, and suite of applications that come bundled together
- Linux + GNU tools + user-facing applications (web browser, email client, etc.) and you have a full Linux system
- there are Linux distributions suited to every imaginable purpose
- there are distributions that focus on running servers, desktops, or even industry-specific tools like electronics design or statistical computing

### Linux Embraces the CLI

- 2 basic types of interfaces available that allow you to interact with the OS
  - Graphical User Interface
  - Command Line Interface
- typical computer user today is familiar with a *graphical user interface*
  - In a GUI, applications present themselves as windows that can be resized and moved around
  - menus and tools to help users navigate
- Command Line Interface
  - text-based interface to the computer
  - CLI relies primarily on keyboard input

## Chapter 2: Operating Systems

- an *operating system* is software that runs on a computing device and manages the hardware and software components that make up a functional computing system
- Three major operating systems:
  - Microsoft Windows
    - unique in its underlying code
  - Apple macOS
    - a fully qualified UNIX distribution based on BSD Unix
    - complemented with a large amount of proprietary code
  - Linux
